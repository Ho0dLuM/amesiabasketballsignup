# Story

- Created this app for my quarter one final project at gShool.
- It has a few bugs and some of the functionality is disabled as to not show someone's cell phone number.
- I wanted to create this app to help out a team of basketball players who have a hard time signing up to play with their current service provider. Tried to make this as simple and easy to use as I could. 

# Features

- Can add and remove your e-mail address to a cell
- When enough people have signed up to play, a text message will be sent to all players that signed up to play on that day. (disabled currently)
